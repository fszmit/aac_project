Summary of assumptions and procedure for the laboratory task:

1. the task can be carried out in teams of no more than four people in one of two versions:
a) basic, the subject of the task is graphs, the solution is rated on a scale up to 3.5 with possible better grade 4.0,
b) advanced, the subject is multigraphs, and the solution is rated on a full scale up to 5.0.
In the case of the advanced version, in the description below, the word graphs means multigraphs.

2. Input data will be saved in a format common to all teams, assuming data interchangeability between teams. These will be text files containing descriptions of (one or more) graphs separated by a blank line. The first line of the file has the number of graphs saved in the file. Graph descriptions are written from the second line:
- the first line of the description contains the number of vertices; this information is saved in one line of the file,
- the following lines of the file contain rows of the adjacency matrix with elements separated by a space,
- additional data may be written after the adjacency matrix in subsequent file lines.
The adjacency matrix contains the number of edges between vertices (for graphs, it will be 0 or 1; for multigraphs, it will be 0 or a positive integer). For undirected graphs, the adjacency matrix will be symmetrical with regard to the main diagonal. Moreover, for example, information about the type of graph can be additionally written directly in lines after the adjacency matrix.

3. The solution to the task will be a report and a computer program compiled and run on computers in laboratory room 303 using Windows. The following concepts should be developed:
a) graph size, please use a reasonable definition consistent with the use of this concept,
b) a reasonable metric in the set of all graphs,
c) maximum cycle in a graph, number of such cycles,
d) minimal extension of a graph with Hamiltonian cycle, number of Hamiltonian cycles.
The report should include:
a) descriptions/definitions of the above concepts with justifications/evidence. Descriptions may be prepared based on literature (in which case the source should be cited and a short justification should be provided) or developed by the author (in such a case, a brief justification of the invented definition should be provided),
b) descriptions of algorithms for implementing concepts with justification of computational complexity. In the case of exponential complexity of the exact algorithm, an approximation algorithm with polynomial complexity should be developed,
c) results of computational tests with time characteristics ("calculation time" depending on the size of the task),
d) a short technical description of the program with detailed instructions for compiling and running the program,
e) conclusions.

4. The laboratory task can be carried out in the following mode:
a) formal, the rules are provided on the course website https://homenda.mini.pw.edu.pl/pages/21,
b) individual.
In both cases, the deadline for submitting the solution to the task is the first week of December, i.e., December 5 at the latest. I encourage teams to turn in their solutions early.

5. The upcoming laboratory meetings will be devoted to organising teams, choosing a topic, determining the place and dates of further meetings, discussing initial ideas and will be carried out according to the following plan of meetings:
- Friday, October 11, 10:15-11:00, 11:15-12:00, 12:15-13:00, 13:15-14:00, 14:15-15:00, 15:15-16:00.

Please have all team members present.

6. There will be no lecture next Thursday, but there will be consultations at 6 pm. Please report to room 329 or room 552.

If no one shows up for a meeting (as in 5. and 6.) within the first 15 minutes, the meeting will be closed.

NOTE: any deviations from the above assumptions should be agreed upon individually.
